linia 81:		Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along.

linia 83:		<p><strong>You there. You and me — we should be here.</strong> It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.</p>
linia 84:		<p>And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.
linia 85:		But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? <strong>I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.</strong></p>
